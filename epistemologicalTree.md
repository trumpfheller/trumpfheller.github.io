- Knowledge is based on reflected, processed information. 
- Information is gathered data and provides meaning and relevance to data.
- Data is raw, unprocessed facts and figures.
- Now, to get from cave paintings to AI, humans had to develop a way to conserve data, information and knowledge - each step, each item through time. 
- to conserve knowledge, information and data, for the past 32.000 years humans used: <br>- stone<br>- clay<br>- leather<br>- Papurus<br>- paper<br>- book <br>- computer
