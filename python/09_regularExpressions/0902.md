## Pattern Matching - Characters

### Literal Characters

* will match the exact character in the string
* includes:
  * digits (0-9)
  * Uppercase and lowercase letters (A-Z, a-z)
  * escaped characters

### Escaped Characters

* there are few character the require escaping to use literally
* backlash (\) turns off the special meaning of a character
* Characters required to be preceded with a backslash(\)
  * ^$+?*()\

### Literal Examples

```bash
'Hello!'
'Goodbye\.' # escape the dot
'End of the line\.\n' # escape the dot, white space new line
'\$100\.00' # escape the dollar sign
'24\+36=60' # escape the + sign
'\\t means tab'
```

### Character Classes

* Contains a range or series of characters
* Correspond to matching a single character
* Surrounded by square brackets

### Defining Character Classes

* within square brackets []:
  * we place one or more literal characters in it
  * we can also place a character range using a start character, a dash and an ending character by specifying a starting character, a dash and an ending character
  Caret (^) [invert he character class by placing] at the beginning of indicates inverse matching

### Character Classes Examples

```bash
[ABCD] # match only A, B, C or D
[aeiou] # match only a,e,i,o,u
[B-E] # match only B, C, D or E
[^B-E] # match anything but B, C, D or E
[a-z0-5] # match letter from a-z(lowercase) or number 0-5.
[^A-z] # match only non alphabet characters
```

### Character Classes Shorthand

* Shorthand to frequently used character classes:
  * Alphanumeric, numeric and whitespace ranges
  * Inverse of the above ranges
  * The dot (.) character matches any character

### Shorthand Character Classes

| Shorthand     | Equivalent    | Description |
| --------|---------|-------|
| `.`  | `.`  |  match any single character except newline  |
|  `\w`  | `[A-z0-9_]`  | alphanumeric and _     |
|  `\W`  | `[^A-z0-9_]`  | non - alphanumerics     |
|  `\d`  | `[0-9]`  | digits    |
|  `\D`  | `[^0-9]`  | non digits     |
|  `\s`  | `[ \b\f\n\r\t\v]`  | whitespace     |
|  `\S`  | `[^ \b\f\n\r\t\v]`  | non whitespace     |

### Shorthand Examples

| Pattern     | Description    | 
| --------|---------|
| `...`  | match any three characters   |
|  `\d\d`  | match any two digits |
| `\w\w\w`  | match any three alphanumeric characters   |
|  `\S`  | match a single - non whitespace character |
| `[A-z]\W`  | match one alphabet followed by a non white space   |
|  `\d\d\D\D`  | match two digits followed by two non-digits |
| `\s\w\s`  | match one alphanumeric characters surrounded by whitespace   |

### Shorthand Matching Examples

* three consecutive digits match

| Pattern     | String    | 
| --------|---------|
| `[0-9][0-9][0-9]`  | 510   |
| `\d\d\d`  | 510   |
| `\d\d\d`  | 94704   |
| `\d\d\d`  | x300   |
| `\d\d\d`  | 42 [no match]   |
