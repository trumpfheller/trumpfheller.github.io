## How to Compile Regular Expressions

### Regex Performance

* Regular Expressions methods compule the regex pattern
* Compilation can be a time-consuming process

### Precompiling Regex

* Option for patterns that do not change
* Ideal when working with a single pattern and multipel strings
* Improves efficiency and speed

### Using the Regex Module

=> import re odule => compile regular expression pattern => get pattern object => call search methods from pattenr object with string

* if no pattern is foudn it will return None
* if a pttern is found it will return a match object 

### Pattern Object Methods

```python
re.compile(pattern, flags=0)

# compile a regex pattern and returns a patter object
# takes optional flags
```

* Similar in form and usage as re search methods
* aready contains a pattern no need to pass it as an argument
* also returns a match object

### Search Method

```python
pattern_object.search(string, start, stop)

# return a match object if the pattern_object is found in string
# return None if not found
# start and stop are opttional indexes for the search range in string
```

### Match Method

```python
pattern_object.match(string, start, stop)

# return a match object if the pattern_object is found at the  beginnign of a  string
# return None if not found
# start and stop are opttional indexes for the search range in string
```

### Find All Method

```python
pattern_object.findall(string, start, stop)

# return a list of substring in string that match the pattern_object
# return None if not found
# start and stop are opttional indexes for the search range in string
```

### Precompilation Example

```python
import re
s = 'software hardware'
pattern= re.compile('ware') # creating a pattern object 
match = pattern.search(s)
 if match:
    print("matched")
    # Output matched
```

### Let's test

```python
# test_regex.py
import unittest
import re

class TestRegexMatch(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_match_found(self):
        s = 'software hardware'
        pattern = re.compile('ware')
        match = pattern.search(s)
        self.assertIsNotNone(match, "Match should be found")

    def test_match_not_found(self):
        s = 'hello world'
        pattern = re.compile('ware')
        match = pattern.search(s)
        self.assertIsNone(match, "Match should not be found")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

> run test with

```sh
python -m unittest test_regex.py
```

### Test Class
* `class TestRegexMatch(unittest.TestCase)`: Defines a class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. 

### Test Methods:
* `test_match_found()`
  * Sets up a string (s) that should contain the match.
  * Creates the regular expression pattern (pattern).
  * Uses `pattern.search(s)` to search for the pattern.
  * `self.assertIsNotNone(match, "Match should be found")`: This assertion checks if the match object is not None, indicating a successful match.
* `test_match_not_found()`:
  * Sets up a string (s) that should not contain the match.
  * The rest of the logic is similar to the previous test.
  * `self.assertIsNone(match, "Match should not be found")`: This assertion checks if the match object is None, indicating that the match was not found.

### Running the Tests:
* `if __name__ == '__main__'`: unittest.main()`
  * to run the tests when you execute the script directly.

* Verify the expected outcomes with assertions like `assertIsNotNone` and `assertIsNone`
* The output will show you the results of each test, indicating whether they passed or failed, along with any error messages.
