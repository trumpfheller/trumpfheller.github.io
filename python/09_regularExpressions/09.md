## Regular Expressions

**Learning Objectives**
* Describe regular expressions
* Precompile regular expressions for speed
* Construct regular expressions using literal and special characters
* Group regular expression patterns for more flexible matching
* Write regular expression with repeating patterns
* Write code to extract text
* Write code to substitute text

### What are Regular Expressions?

* ways to search, extract and substitute patterns in string
* use literal and special characters
* Act as a compact mini language

### Regular Expressions Advantages

* works well with strings with patterns
* more compact code than using string methods , slicing and or indexing
easier to maintain
Available in other programming languages

### String Examples With Patterns

* License plate numbers
* phone numbers
    1-500-555-1212
    415-555-2020
    (650)777-5555
* filenames

### The Regular Expression Module

* Built in module for regular expressions
* contains methods to search for regex patterns
* returns a match object
  * Contains details about the matched pattern 

### Using the Regex Module

import the re module => call search methods with regular expression pattern and string => Match object is returned 

### Search Method Method

### Search Method

```python
re.search(pattern, string)

# return a match object if a regex pattern is found in string 
# return None if not found
```

### Match Method

```python
re.match(pattern, string)

# return a match object if a regex pattern is found at the beginning of string 
# return None if not found
```

### Find All All Method

```python
re.findall(pattern, string)

# return a list of all substrings in string that matches the regex pattern 
# return empty list if nothing is found
```

### Search Example

```python
import re
pattern= 'ware'
s = 'software hardware'
 if re.search(pattern, s):
    print('matched')
```

### Match Object

* returned when a pattern is found
* contains additinal information about a match, such as groups
*  group() method returns actual pattern that was matched

### Match Object Example

```python
import re
pattern= 'ware'
s = 'software hardware'
mo = re.search(pattern, s)
 if mo:
    print(mo.group())
    # Output ware
```
