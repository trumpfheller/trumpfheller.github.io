### Why design out own Classes?

* existing types can be inadequate, we need to design our own data types
* existing data types might not be sufficient in modeling or providing what we need.
* classes have encapsulation as a property - combining of data and functions into one unit (those would be separate in **procedural** programming)
* leads to a better organization (changes can be done in one area of code without affecting the rest)

### Limitations of Procedural Programming

```python
# using procedural programming
def area(side):
    return side*side
mysquare = [2,10, 15]
# list of squares

for side in mysquares:
    # print out the area for each
    print(f'Area: {area(side)}')

    #Output
    Area:   4
    Area:   100
    Area:   225 
```

now we introduce a new shape, a rectangle (width and hight)
=> let's put them in a tuple

```python
def area(side):
    return side*side
myshapes = [2,10, 15, (7,4), (12,8)]
# list of squares

for side in myshapes :
    # print out the area for each
    print(f'Area: {area(side)}')
```

this will create a Type error: multiple sequences by non-int of type 'tuple'
We need to add a function for that

```python
def square_area(side):
    return side*side
myshapes = [2,10, 15, (7,4), (12,8)]

def rect_area(width, hight):
    return width*hight
myshapes = [2,10, 15, (7,4), (12,8)]

for side in myshapes :
    print(f'Area: {area(side)}')
```

now we need to know if our data is a square or rectangle
so we can call correct area function.

```python
def square_area(side):
    return side*side
myshapes = [2,10, 15, (7,4), (12,8)]

def rect_area(width, hight):
    return width*hight
myshapes = [('square',2),('square',10),('square',15), ('rectagle',7,4), ('rectagle',12,8)]

for side in myshapes :
    print(f'Area: {area(side)}')
```

now we have to make a change in the for loop.
we need to determine what the shape is so we can tell which function to call.

```python
def square_area(side):
    return side*side
myshapes = [2,10, 15, (7,4), (12,8)]

def rect_area(width, hight):
    return width*hight
myshapes = [('square',2),('square',10),('square',15), ('rectagle',7,4), ('rectagle',12,8)]

for shape in myshapes :
    if shape[0]=='square':
        print(f'Area: {square_area(side[1])}')
    elif shape[0]=='rectagle':
        print(f'Area: {rect_area(shape[1], shape[2])}')
    #Output
    Area:   4
    Area:   100
    Area:   225 
    Area:   28 
    Area:   96 

```

if we had to add more shapes and function and shapes properties
