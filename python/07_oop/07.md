## Basic Structure of OOP in Python

**Objects are instances of Classes**
– Can have multiple objects of the same Class type
– E.g., You would be an instance of the Human class: you have the properties of your Class(Human)
– No `main()` function (Class is not a program)

### Classes 

* are blueprints or templates for creating objects. 
* They encapsulate data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class can exhibit.

```python
class ClassName:
    # Attributes (data)
    def __init__(self, params):
        self.attribute = params

    # Methods (behaviors)
    def method(self):
        # Method body
```

```python
class Classname:
    def __init__(self, additional parameters):
        # Constructor
    body
    self.variable_name = value # example instance variable
    
    # Method
    def method_name(self, additional parameters):
        body
```

### Objects (Instances):

* Objects are instances of classes. 
* Object Creation using the class name followed by parentheses ().


```python
obj = ClassName(params)
```

### Attributes

* Variables that belong to a class/object.

```python
obj.attribute
```

### Method
* Functions defined within a class that perform operations on objects of that class.

```python
obj.method()
```

> TASK
* Practice with Examples: 
  * Write and execute sample code to understand how classes, objects, attributes, and methods interact.
* Visualize Concepts: 
  * Draw diagrams or flowcharts to visualize class hierarchies, attribute access, and method invocation.

---

### Example Square class

```python
class Square:
    def __init__(self, side):
        # method
        self.side = side
        # (self.side) called class member 
    def area(self):
        return self.side*self.side
s1 = Square(2)
print(s1.area())
```

### Example rectangle class

```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

    def __str__(self):
        #  __str__ for better object representation
        return f"Rectangle(width={self.width}, height={self.height})"

#  to handle user input with error handling.
def create_rectangle():
    while True:
        try:
            width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))
            height = float(input("Enter the height of the rectangle: "))
            return Rectangle(width, height)
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input. Please enter numeric values for width and height.")

# Create a rectangle with user input
r1 = create_rectangle()
print(r1)

# Print the area of the rectangle
print(f"Area of the rectangle: {r1.area()}")

'''
OUTPUT
Enter the width of the rectangle: 3
Enter the height of the rectangle: 4
Rectangle(width=3.0, height=4.0)
Area of the rectangle: 12.0
'''
```

### Example shape class

```python
class Shape:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def area(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement this method")

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.__class__.__name__}"

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        super().__init__()
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Rectangle(width={self.width}, height={self.height})"

class Triangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, base, height):
        super().__init__()
        self.base = base
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return 0.5 * self.base * self.height

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Triangle(base={self.base}, height={self.height})"

def create_shape():
    shape_type = input("Enter the type of shape (rectangle/triangle): ").lower()
    
    if shape_type == "rectangle":
        width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))
        height = float(input("Enter the height of the rectangle: "))
        return Rectangle(width, height)
    
    elif shape_type == "triangle":
        base = float(input("Enter the base of the triangle: "))
        height = float(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))
        return Triangle(base, height)
    
    else:
        print("Invalid shape type")
        return None

# Create a shape with user input
shape = create_shape()
if shape:
    print(shape)
    print(f"Area of the {shape}: {shape.area()}")

'''
Enter the type of shape (rectangle/triangle): rectangle
Enter the width of the rectangle: 2
Enter the height of the rectangle: 3
Rectangle(width=2.0, height=3.0)
Area of the Rectangle(width=2.0, height=3.0): 6.0
'''
```

### Example

* code defines a class Hello that can be instantiated with a text string and then called like a function to print that text string.
* When `printer = Hello("Hello World")` is executed, it creates an instance of Hello with `self.txt` set to "Hello World".
* When `printer()` is called, it triggers the `__call__` method, which prints the value of `self.txt`, which is "Hello World".

```python
class Hello:
    def __init__(self,gtext):
        self.txt = gtext
      '''
        - constructor method for the Hello class => 
        called when an instance of the class is created. 
        - It takes one parameter gtext and assigns it 
        to an instance variable self.txt.'''
    def __call__(self):
        print(self.txt)
        '''
        - special method allows an instance of the class 
        to be called as if it were a function. 
        - When an instance is called, it tries to print self.text.
        '''
      
def main():
    printer = Hello("Hello World")
    # creates an instance of the Hello class with gtext set to "Hello World".
    printer()
    # tries to call the instance, which triggers the __call__ method.
try:
    if __name__=="__main__":
        #  ensures that the main() function is called only if 
        # this script is executed directly, not if it is imported as a module.
        main()
except Exception as e:
    exit()
'''
- to handle any exceptions that might occur during the execution of main(). 
- If an exception occurs, the script will exit gracefully.
'''
```

Advantages of OOP:
* code reusability, 
* modularity, and 
* easier maintenance.
* classes are user definable data types

## Principles of Object-Oriented Programming
* inheritance, and 
* polymorphism
* encapsulation, 
* abstraction

## Basic Information Flow in OOP:

### 1. Instantiation:

* Creating an object (instance) of a class.

```python
obj = ClassName()
```

### 2. Accessing Attributes:

Retrieve or modify the object's data.

```python
obj.attribute = value
```

### 3. Calling Methods:

* Invoke behaviors defined in the class.

```python
obj.method()
```
### 4. Inheritance:

* Creating a new class from an existing class, inheriting its attributes and methods.

```python
class ChildClass(ParentClass):
    # Additional attributes and methods
```

### 5. Polymorphism:

* The ability to use a method from the parent class in a child class with different implementations.

```python
class ChildClass(ParentClass):
    def method(self):
        # Override parent method
```

### 6. Encapsulation:

* Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class), and restricting access to some of the object's components.

```python
class ClassName:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.__data = data  # Private attribute

    def method(self):
        # Access private attribute within the class
        return self.__data
```
