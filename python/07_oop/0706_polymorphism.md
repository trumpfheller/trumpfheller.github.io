## Polymorphism

- ability of different objects to respond to the same message or method call in different ways. 
- It allows objects of different types to be treated as if they were instances of a common superclass, enabling more flexible and dynamic code.

two main types of polymorphism in Python:

### Method Overriding: 
This occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. When the method is called on an object of the subclass, the subclass's implementation is executed instead of the superclass's implementation.

### Duck Typing: 
This is a concept in Python where the type or the class of an object is less important than the methods it defines. If an object implements a particular method or set of methods, it can be used wherever that method or set of methods is expected, regardless of its actual type.

```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement this method")

'''
Both Dog and Cat classes inherit from the Animal class and
override its speak() method with their own implementations.
'''
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Meow!"

# Function that uses polymorphism
def make_sound(animal):
    return animal.speak()

# Creating instances of Dog and Cat
dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

# Calling the function with different objects
print(make_sound(dog))  # Output: Woof!
'''
The make_sound() function accepts any object that has a speak() method (duck typing),
allowing it to work with both Dog and Cat objects interchangeably.
'''
print(make_sound(cat))  # Output: Meow!
'''
When make_sound() is called with a Dog object, it executes the speak() method of the Dog class,
and when called with a Cat object, it executes the speak() method of the Cat class.
'''
```
