### What is the Requests Module?

* HTTP/HTTPS library for Python
* fetch files over the internet
* Abstracts connection details
* Akin to a browser without the user interface

### Requests Installation

```bash
pip3 install requests
```

### Uniform Resource Locator

* also known as URL or web address
* reference to web pages, files and other internet resources

### URL Parts

* http is the protocol
* www.berkeley.com is the host name
* /extension/resources.html is the path
* s=python is the query string (allows to send informtion to the server)

### Fetching Internet Resources

user >> sending a request >> server
server >> sending a response which contains the resource >> client

import request module >> prepare request >. send request >> get response >> process response

### Import the Requests Module

```python
import requests
```

### Preparing the Request

* prepare the complete URL in string format
* parameters for name-value entries in the form of a dictionary (which tehen will be sent as a query string)

### Sending the Request

* send the request using the `get()`method

### Get Method

```python
import requests
requests.get(url, parameters={})
```

reteieve the url resource and return a response object parameters are mebedded and encouded in the URL.

### Getting the Response

* response object is returned by the `get()` call
* ifthe server is down or it is is an unknown server, `get()` will throw a ConnectionError >> check URL

import request module >> prepare request >> send request >> get response

### Processing the Response

if the GET or the POST call receive a response check the status by using response.ok is True:
  * response object will contain the contents of the requested resources
otherwise
  * examine response.status_code

import request module >> prepare request >. send request >> get response >> process response

### Response Properties

* response.ok
  * True when the fetch request is successful
* `response.status_code`
  * the HTTP status code returned by the server

### Common HTTP Status Codes

|   |   |    | 
|---|---|   | 
|  200 | Successful Response |  nothing more to do | 
|  400 | Bad Request  | 400-499 indicate error on client side  | 
|  401 | Unauthorized  |   | 
|  404 | Reource Not Found  | might also be a typo in url | 
| 500  | Internal Server Error  | there is nothing we can do about | 

### Text Contents

* if we expect text, we should check the text files, using response.text
* usually contains the text encoded, Unicode version in string format

### Binary Contents

* for binary files, use `response.content`
* contains the raw, unencoded contents in byte format
* use the ginary files, such as images, sound, encrypted files, etc.

### Response Object Properties

response.content
  * the raw contents of the response (byte format)

response.text
* the test encoded contents of the respponse (string format)

### Requests Example

```python
import request

url = 'https://www.python.org'
response = requests.get(url)
with open ('index.html', 'w') as html_file:
    if response.ok:
        html_file.write(response.text)
        print('finished printing')
```

```python
import request

url = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/80/Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg/440px-Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg.png'
response = requests.get(url)
with open ('wiki-logo.png', 'wb') as png_file:
    # set the context manager to download a binary file
    if response.ok:
        png_file.write(response.content)
        print('finished printing')
```
