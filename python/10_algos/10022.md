## Binary Search with Dictionary

- dictionaries are not typically used for binary search because they are per defintion unordered
- so, I just simulate a binary search by sorting the dictionary keys and performing a binary search on the sorted keys. 

```python
def binary_search_dict(d, target):
    # Get the sorted list of dictionary keys
    sorted_keys = sorted(d.keys())
    
    # Initialize the low and high pointers
    low = 0
    high = len(sorted_keys) - 1
    
    # While the search space is valid
    while low <= high:
        # Find the middle index
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        mid_key = sorted_keys[mid]
        
        # Check if the target value is at the mid index
        if d[mid_key] == target:
            return mid_key
        # If the target is greater than the mid element, ignore the left half
        elif d[mid_key] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        # If the target is less than the mid element, ignore the right half
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    # Return None if the target is not found
    return None

# Example usage:
d = {'a': 10, 'b': 20, 'c': 30, 'd': 40, 'e': 50}
target = 30
result = binary_search_dict(d, target)
if result is not None:
    print(f"Value {target} found with key '{result}'")
else:
    print(f"Value {target} not found in the dictionary")
```
