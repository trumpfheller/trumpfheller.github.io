title: Python Algos - pytesting Binarr Search
layout: default
---

## Code for pytesting 

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    # Initialize the low and high pointers
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    
    # While the search space is valid
    while low <= high:
        # Find the middle index
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        # Check if the target is at the mid index
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        # If the target is greater than the mid element, ignore the left half
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        # If the target is less than the mid element, ignore the right half
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    # Return -1 if the target is not found
    return -1

# Example
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
target = 7
result = binary_search(arr, target)
if result != -1:
    print(f"Element {target} found at index {result}")
else:
    print(f"Element {target} not found in the list")
```

### TCs for pytest

```python
import pytest
# Test Cases for pytest
@pytest.mark.parametrize("arr, target, expected", [
    ([2, 3, 4, 10, 40], 10, 3),
    ([2, 3, 4, 10, 40], 20, -1),
    ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3, 2),
    ([], 10, -1),
    ([1], 1, 0),
    ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], 7, 6),  # Test case for your example
])
def test_binary_search(arr, target, expected):
    assert binary_search(arr, target) == expected
```

### Test Cases:
  * `[arr, target, expected]`: This is the list of test cases, each containing:
    * `arr`: The sorted array to search in.
    * `target`: The element you're searching for.
    * `expected`: The expected index where the element should be found (or -1 if not found).
* `assert binary_search(arr, target) == expected`: This assertion verifies that the actual result returned by the binary_search function matches the expected value for each TC.
* Assertion statement for verifying if the actual result matches the expected result.
* TCs cover various scenarios (empty array, target not found, target in the middle, target at the edges, etc.).

### Test Report - Console Output
> pytest test_binary_search.py
```sh
Passed/failed tests
Test durations
Error messages (if any)
A summary of the results at the end.
```

### Test Report - Console Output
* pytest can generate an XML report in JUnit format, which is used in CI/CD pipelines.

```sh
pytest --junitxml=report.xml test_binary_search.py
```

* check for report.xml in the current directory

### Test Report - HTML Report

```sh
pip install pytest-html
pytest --html=report.html test_binary_search.py
```

* This will create an report.html
  * Test summaries
  * Pass/fail indicators
  * Test durations
  * Error/failure details

* I never used `pytest markers` to group tests or categorize them (@pytest.mark.slow, @pytest.mark.integration, etc.).
* `pytest fixtures` help to set up common data or resources for your tests. Again, never used it.

### pytesting #2

```python
def binary_search(arr, x):
  """Performs binary search on a sorted array.

  Args:
    arr: The sorted array to search in.
    x: The element to search for.

  Returns:
    The index of the element if found, otherwise -1.
  """
  low = 0
  high = len(arr) - 1
  while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if arr[mid] == x:
      return mid
    elif arr[mid] < x:
      low = mid + 1
    else:
      high = mid - 1
  return -1


### TCs for pytest
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("arr, x, expected", [
    ([2, 3, 4, 10, 40], 10, 3),
    ([2, 3, 4, 10, 40], 20, -1),
    ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3, 2),
    ([], 10, -1),
    ([1], 1, 0),
])
def test_binary_search(arr, x, expected):
  assert binary_search(arr, x) == expected
```

* binary_search() function takes a sorted array arr and a target element x and returns the index of x if found, otherwise -1.
* `@pytest.mark.parametrize`: This decorator helps create multiple test cases with different inputs and expected outputs.
* Test Cases:
  * We define a list of test cases [arr, x, expected] using the parametrize decorator. Each test case contains:
  * `arr`: The sorted array to search.
  * `x`: The target element to find.
  * `expected`: The expected result (index or -1).
* Corner Cases: It has various corner cases (empty array, target not found, target at the edge, etc.) that require testing.
