### Hash Table Search:
* Uses a hash function to map keys to indices.
* Very fast for lookups, insertions, and deletions.
* Requires extra memory for the hash table.

### Tree Search:
* Utilizes tree data structures.
* Different types exist, including Binary Search Tree (BST), AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree.
* Provides efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

### Graph Search:
* Explores nodes in a graph.
* Algorithms include Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
* Used for solving problems involving interconnected entities.
