### white-box versus black-box testing.

**White-box testing** 
- tester has knowledge of the internal structure and implementation details of the system being tested. 
- examining the code and testing specific paths, branches, and conditions to ensure they behave as expected.

**Black-box testing**
- tester has no knowledge of the internal workings of the system. 
- It focuses on testing the system's external behavior and functionality based on its specifications or requirements.

Note to myself: maybe adding some more regression testing?

### concept of regression testing and why it is important.
- is the process of retesting a modified or updated software system to ensure that the existing functionality has not been affected by the changes. It involves rerunning previously executed test cases to verify that the system still behaves correctly after the introduction of new code or modifications.


- is important because software systems are often complex and interconnected. Even a small change in one part of the system can inadvertently introduce bugs or cause unexpected behavior in other parts. By performing regression testing, we can catch these issues early and ensure the overall stability and reliability of the system.
