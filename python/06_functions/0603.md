title: Python - Functions - Return statement
layout: default

## Return statement

* Consits of the return keyword and an expression
* when the return stement executes, it exits the function
* to end a function
* send the result back to the caller

```python
def f(p1,p2):
    return expression

x = f(arg1, arg2)
```

* Send expression back to the caller.

### Implied Return Statement

* Functions without return stament implicetly return a None
  it is the equivalent of returning a non-value. This makes it act like a procedure.
* Makes a function act like a procedure
* Examples include print(), sort() method

=> the difference between a function and procedures (in most cases functions provide more flexibility)

```python
# procedure
def cube1(n):
    print(n*n*n)

cube1(10)

# adding two cube results
cube1(2)+cube1(5)
# Output
# TypeError
n1 = cube1(2)
n2 = cube1(5)
print(n1)
# Output
None
```

You can avoid this with a function

```python
# function

def cube2(n):
    return n*n*n
    # instead of printing an expression will return it by using return
n1 = cube2(2)
n2 = cube2(5)
n1+n2
# Output
# 133

# same result for 
cube2(2) + cube2(5)
```

* use the procedure if you don't need the return value.
