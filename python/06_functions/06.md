## Functions
> [Python Style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

### The 3 steps of a function

1. input
2. transform
3. Output

you can do two things with functions

* Define it (a block of re-usable code => loop)
* call it

```python
# define the function
def do_nothing(parameters):
        # since functions do something, use a verb as function name
    pass

# call the function
do_nothing()
```

### Examples of functions

* len
* open
* reversed
* password_validator

### Programming interface

* Function caller (client) only needs to know about the inputs and output
  * Implementation details are hidden, how it does the processing is hidden from us (Like a black box)
* Because we don't know the implementation we can concentrate on higher level thingking - how modules work together, instead of how they work.

### Calling Functions

* function name and parenthesis and values (arguments within the parenthesis)
* number of arguments depends on the function's defintion

### Function implementation

* is ideally self contained.
* we will only change this part of code should we need to fix bugs or come up with a better algorithm
* we use parameters as part of the processing
* Returns an output


### Readability counts docstring vs comments [Zen of Python]

> ***docstring*** describes the function's external behavior, and the parameters it takes.
> ***comments*** should document internal info about how the code works. 

* documentation to a function definition (page 152)

```python
def echo(anything):
    'echo returns its input argument'
    return anything
```
