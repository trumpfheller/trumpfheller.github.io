## Programming Paradigms

* models for best practices to manage more complex code and decrease development time. 
* We will focus on procedural programming, which centers on the concept of procedures and functions.
* allow us to isolate different subtasks within a program and deal with each individually.  And later, if we think of a better way to solve a problem, or if we detect an error in the logic, there's only one place that we need to make changes. 
* When we modify a function, all the programs that use the function will incorporate the changes the next time they're called, because the updated function will be imported by any program that calls it.

### What is a Programming Paradigm? 

* A model for programing
* uses specific collection of conccepts and practices for
  * approaching a problem
  * implementation fo techniques
  * structuring a solution

to improve
* code clarity
* code quality
* reduce developing time
* and manage complexity

You can use one or multiple paradigms in your program

### Types of Programming Paradigms

```text
* Imperative Programming
* structured Programming
* Procedural Programming
* Procedures
* Object Oriented
```

### Imperative Programming

Has statements 

* entered in a specific order
* that are executed step by step

### Structured Programming

* has all Imperative Programming features
* Uses of control tructure (if, for, while)
* Uses iteration to solve problems

### Procedural Programming

* has all Structured Programming features
* Groups related pieces of code into modules or functions (modularity)
* Divides complex task into smaller  tasks
* that leads to - Makes code more reusable and flexible

### Procedures

The buidling blocks of modularity are procedures. 

* are codeblocks with names
* Are initiated by procedure calls
* their execution is initiated by a procedure call.

### Examples

* Sort a list
* Delete unused files
* clip the first 10 seconds of a video
* print a pdf file
* retrieve stock prize for today's biggest mover.

Procedures and functions can also accepts values as input.

### Arguments

* Values (inputs) passed to a procedure or a function 
* allow more flexibility and versatile  

### Arguments Examples

* diretion of a sort (either ascending or descending)
* clip seconds
* pages (range and number of copies)
* copies
